I am an open-minded, pragmatic, and optimistic individual that passionately believes that technology can change the world. In my journey so far, I have seen how tech-based solutions can be applied to solve real-world problems. This has pushed me to look for opportunities where I can leverage my tech skills to offer solutions that have a long-term and sustainable impact.

To realize this goal, I have been improving my soft skills as well as my technical expertise from opportunities gained in this industry.

I thrive in an environment that encourages creativity, teamwork, and growth-based mindset.
